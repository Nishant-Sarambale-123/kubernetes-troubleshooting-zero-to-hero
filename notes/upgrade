Got it 👍 — you’re asking about a **production-grade Kubernetes upgrade procedure on AWS** (like **EKS** or self-managed Kubernetes on EC2 with `kubeadm`), with **real-world prerequisites and process**.

Here’s how you can confidently explain it in an interview 👇

---

# 🚀 **Kubernetes Upgrade Procedure on AWS (Production)**

## ✅ **Prerequisites (must check before starting)**

1. **Release Notes Review**

   * Read Kubernetes version release notes (control plane + kubelet + API changes).
   * Identify deprecated APIs (e.g., `extensions/v1beta1`).

2. **Lower Environment Testing**

   * Test upgrade in **dev/stage clusters** before prod.
   * Run automated regression & integration tests.

3. **Cluster Health Check**

   * Ensure no failing Pods (`kubectl get pods -A`).
   * Monitoring/alerts working (Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch).

4. **Networking / IP Availability**

   * At least **5 free IP addresses per subnet** (needed by AWS CNI for new Pods during upgrade).

5. **Cluster Autoscaler**

   * Upgrade **Cluster Autoscaler** to a version compatible with the new Kubernetes release.

6. **Node Readiness**

   * Verify kubelet & kube-proxy versions.
   * Check if DaemonSets (CNI, CSI drivers, logging agents) support new version.

7. **Backup**

   * Take **etcd backup** (if self-managed).
   * For EKS → not direct etcd access, but backup workloads (Velero, EBS snapshots).

## 🛠 **Upgrade Process**

### 1. **Control Plane**

* If using **EKS**:

  ```bash
  eksctl upgrade cluster --name <cluster-name> --version <new-version>
  ```

  or via AWS Console.

* If using **kubeadm (self-managed)**:

  ```bash
  kubeadm upgrade plan
  kubeadm upgrade apply v1.x.x
  ```

👉 This step upgrades the **API server, controller-manager, scheduler, etcd**.

---

### 2. **Worker Nodes**

* Upgrade nodes **one by one** to avoid downtime.
  Steps:

```bash
kubectl cordon <node-name>          # prevent new pods
kubectl drain <node-name> \
  --ignore-daemonsets \
  --delete-emptydir-data            # evict workloads
```

* Upgrade AMI (if EKS-managed node groups, just update node group version).
* Or on EC2 (self-managed):

  * Update kubelet + kubectl.
  * Restart services.
* Bring node back:

```bash
kubectl uncordon <node-name>
```

* Repeat for all nodes.

---

### 3. **Cluster Add-ons**

* Upgrade/add compatibility for:

  * **AWS VPC CNI plugin**
  * **CoreDNS**
  * **kube-proxy**
  * **Cluster Autoscaler**

  ```bash
  eksctl utils update-coredns --cluster <name>
  eksctl utils update-kube-proxy --cluster <name>
  eksctl utils update-aws-node --cluster <name>
  ```

---

### 4. **Workloads**

* Verify all workloads are healthy.
* Run smoke tests & monitoring.
* Watch for API deprecation warnings in `kubectl logs -n kube-system kube-apiserver-*`.

---

## 🔄 **Rollback Plan**

* EKS: If upgrade fails → restore from AMI snapshot or recreate node groups with old version.
* Self-managed: Use `etcd` backup to restore control plane.
* Workloads: Rollback deployments with:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment <name>
```

## ✅ **Interview-ready Answer**

> In production on AWS, we upgrade Kubernetes carefully. First, we check prerequisites: release notes, test in lower env, ensure at least 5 free IPs in each subnet, validate kubelet/cluster-autoscaler versions, and back up etcd/workloads. Then, we upgrade the **control plane first** (via EKS version upgrade or kubeadm). Next, we upgrade worker nodes one at a time — cordon, drain, upgrade, uncordon. After nodes, we upgrade cluster add-ons like VPC CNI, CoreDNS, kube-proxy, and Cluster Autoscaler. Finally, we validate workloads, run smoke tests, and monitor system metrics. If issues arise, we roll back using etcd backup or by recreating node groups with the previous version.
